# DynamicChartJS.js
This allows you to create dynamic charts while using Chart.JS, I plan to allow the user to swap all variables that's required with Chart.js. It currently has no major bugs, from personal testing, I've seen that it even works in IE8, although I've written it in vanilla JavaScript, you can also use jQuery with it.
